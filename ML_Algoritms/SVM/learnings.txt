SVM => Support Vector Machine:
         Used for classification (also regression) tasks similar to what we did with K Nearest Neighbors. It is a powerful tool that is a good choice for
        classifying complicated data with a high degree of dimensions(features). Note that K-Nearest Neighbors does not perform well on high-dimensional data.
        
=> Loading data:
    Sklearn provides with some dataset to work on. (dataset.load) that are much easy to use.

=> Working Process:
    Hyper plane:
