# Object Oriented Programming in Python
'''
    All data types defined are part of class. ie, when we initialize a variable we're basically creating an object which is an instance of a class. 
            For example, when we create a variable of type int, we're creating an object of class int. 
    Similarly operstions on objects of different types arre not defined.
            For example, we cannot add an int and a string.

     We can create our own classes and define our own data types.
            For example, we can create a class called Student and define a data type called Student.
    We can also define operations/functions/methods on our own data types.
            For example, we can define a method called get_name() on Student class to get the name of the student.
