=> Libraries used: 
    Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames 
            to efficiently handle and analyze structured data. Pandas offers various functions and methods for tasks such as 
            reading and writing data, filtering, transforming, and summarizing data, handling missing values, and merging datasets.

    Numpy: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays
           and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is commonly used for 
           tasks involving numerical operations, linear algebra, random number generation, and data reshaping.

    Scikit-learn: It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for various machine learning tasks, including classification,
                  regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model selection.

    Linear Regression from Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn provides a linear_model module that includes various linear regression models.
                 Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable
                 and one or more independent variables.
    
    Matplotlib:  Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python. It provides a flexible and comprehensive set of functions
               for creating various types of plots and visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc.
               It is highly customisable allowing you to control aspects like axes, labels, colors, and annotations to create visually appealing plots.

    Pickle: Allows you to save Python objects to a file and load them back into memory. Pickle is commonly used for tasks like 
            saving trained machine learning models to disk for later use or sharing.

    R2 Score from Scikit-learn: R2 score, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a metric used to evaluate the 
                performance of regression models. It measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can 
                be explained by the independent variables.

    Style from Matplotlib: Style is a submodule of Matplotlib that allows you to customize the appearance of your plots 
                            by applying predefined or user-defined styles.


=> Linking the spreadsheet with pythin file
 ''' read_csv() => a function in pandas to read data from csv file.
    .csv stands for comma separated values
    sep => It stores the delimiter (character that separates the values in a csv file)
'''

# Each column corresponds to an attribute.

=> Removing the attribute that is to be determined
''' Will return DataFrame with no column for G3 and it is going to be our training data, ie, x will have all the attributes except the label (attributes to be predicted)
    1 is the value of the axis parameter
    Axis paramter=> It denotes the axis or parameter along which the operation is to be performed ie, axis=0: along ROW (horizontally) and axis=1: along COLUMN (vertically)
'''

=> Spliting of data
'''
    train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection module is used to split the dataset into training and testing subsets as follows:
    Parameters it takes:
        x: input features | y: target variable of the dataset that is to be splitted 
        test_size: This parameter determines the proportion of the dataset that will be allocated for testing. In this case, test_size=0.1 indicates that 10% of the
                   data will be used for testing, while the remaining 90% will be used for training.
    Outputs:
        x_train: contains the training data for the input features. It will be used to train the machine learning model.
        y_train: contains the training data for the target variable. It corresponds to the target values of the x_train data.
        x_test: contains the testing data for the input features. It will be used to evaluate the trained model's performance.
        y_test: contains the testing data for the target variable. It corresponds to the target values of the x_test data.

    ie, By splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, you can train a machine learning model on the training data and then evaluate its performance on the unseen testing data.

=> Linear Regression
    # Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict the value of a continuous variable based on one or more input features.
    # Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y).

'''
    LinearRegression() => It is a function in the linear_model module of the sklearn library that is used to perform linear regression in Python.
                          Line 64: Creates an instance of the LinearRegression class, which represents a linear regression model.
    The fit() method is used to train the linear regression model on the training data. It takes two arguments: x_train represents the input features or independent
                        variables, and y_train represents the target variable or dependent variable.
    The score() method is used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model. It takes two arguments: x_test represents the input features of the testing
                        data, and y_test represents the target variable of the testing data. The score() method returns the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) of the prediction.
'''

=> Saving the trained model
    Pickle is used to save the trained model so that we don't have to train the model everytime we want to use it. Here a file named studentmodel.pickle is created and the trained model is saved in it.
    wb => write bytes
    pickle.dump() => It is used to save the trained model in the studentmodel.pickle file. It takes two arguments: the first argument is the trained model, and the second argument is the file object.

=> Loading the saved model:
    pickle.load() => It is used to load the trained model from the studentmodel.pickle file. It takes one argument, which is the file object.
    By loading the trained model, you can use it to generate predictions on the unseen data. 

=> Predicting with the trained model:
    predict() => Used to generate predictions using the trained (linear regression) model on the test data.
    The for loop iterates through the predictions list and prints the predicted value, the input features, and the actual value of the target variable.
