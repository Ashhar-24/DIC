=> Supervised/Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
    Divided based on type of training data they use and the objective they aim to achieve.
        Supervised learning:  The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the correct labels for new, unseen inputs. The process involves
        training the model using labeled examples, where the algorithm learns from the input-output pairs.
        Characteristics of supervised learning:
                a. Labelled data:  Includes both input features and their corresponding correct output labels.
                b. Learning task:  The model learns to generalize patterns and relationships between input features and output labels
                c. Objective: The primary objective is to minimize the prediction error or maximize the accuracy of the model's predictions.
                Examples:  Classification and regression

        Unsupervised learning: The training data consists of only input data (features) without any corresponding labels. The goal is to find patterns, structures, or 
        relationships within the data without explicit guidance or predefined categories. Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover meaningful insights and
        representations from the data.
        Characteristics of unsupervised learning:
                a. Unlabeled data: The training data only contains input features without any associated labels or targets.
                b. Learning task: The model explores the inherent structure of the data, identifying patterns, similarities, or clusters without predefined categories.
                c. Objective: The primary objective is to uncover hidden patterns, groupings, or representations that can provide insights into the data.
                Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection

        Summary: Supervised learning deals with labeled data and aims to learn a mapping between input features and output labels for prediction or 
        classification tasks. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and focuses on discovering hidden patterns, structures, or relationships
        within the data without any predefined categories.

=> K Means Clustering: Cluster means to group similar data points together. 'K' (0-9) here means how many clusters (sections) are the data points to be divided. 
                We do it by placing k centroids (randomly) and repeat this process:
                    Step 1: Randomly pick K points to place K centroids 
                    Step 2: Assign all of the data points to the centroids by distance. The closest centroid to a point is the one it is assigned to. 
                    Step 3: Average all of the points belonging to each centroid to find the middle of those clusters (center of mass). 
                        Place the corresponding centroids into that position. 
                    Step 4: Reassign every point once again to the closest centroid. 
                    Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until no point changes which centroid it belongs to.
